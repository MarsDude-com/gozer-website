title = "My first distro challenge"
+++

In the 29 years I have been using Linux, a LOT of distributions have lived inside my computer(s) for a period of time. Some for a couple of days, others for a lot longer.

I am a notorious ditrohopper. Sometimes I get tired of it myself :-) 

My first distro's I tried were Red Hat and Slackware, back in 1996. I still have those CD-ROMs! Slackware was my favourite for a long time. No matter what distro I tried, I always came back to it. I learned a lotfrom using Slackware. 

The last couple of years Void Linux and OpenSUSE (Tumbleweed and Leap) have been the ones I really liked. And at the moment OpenSUSE Leap is on my server, and Linux Mint on my laptop.

I have used distro's that were based on Ubuntu (like Linux Mint right now), and used it a little bit on a small server in the past. But actually... I have never really ran it as a daily driver. Seriously. I've probably ran more than 50 distro's in my life for more than a week, but Ubuntu wasn't one of them as far as I can remember.

As with everything, a lot of opinions are continuously being thrown online about Ubuntu. And well, to be honoust: If I got to design my own distro, it probably would differ a lot from Ubuntu. But I am totally unfit for having my own distro, so I'll leave that to those who know what they're doing. Like Canonical. 

Ubuntu is a big and important distro, that did a lot for the adoption and development of Linux (no, don't send comments about GNU/Linux, about 'Linux is only the kernel' etc... When I say Linux I mean the whole ecosystem). So I thought it would be a nice idea to give Ubuntu a good and fair try. 

So... a distro challenge! I am committing myself to using Ubuntu for the next 6 months, starting next week. On april 17th 2025, Ubuntu 25.04 will officially be released, so that one will be on my laptop. For my server, I'm going with 24.04 LTS.

And I'll try using it as it was intended. So on my laptop I'll run the Gnome DE with the changes made to it by Ubuntu, I'll get a free pro account, I'll use snaps, etc, etc.

And along the way, I'll post more updates about this little journey. I'm expecting the biggest challenge will be to resist the temptation to hop again within 6 months ;-)

Wish me luck!

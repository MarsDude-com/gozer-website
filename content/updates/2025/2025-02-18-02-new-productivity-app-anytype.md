title = "Anytype: My new productivity app?"
+++

At the moment I use Obsidian for my notes (Building A Second Brain), and Nirvana for my ToDo's (Getting Things Done). I 'sort of' managed to incorporate GTD into Obsidian, but it isn't perfect. 

Yesterday I noticed an app called 'Anytype' which looks very promising. From their own description:

> Anytype is a local-first, E2E encrypted software designed as a secure place to create and store digital assets.
>
> You can use Anytype to create and connect your tasks, notes, ideas, documents, workflows, and more.

That does sound interesting... I'm going to have a look at it. I'll let you know!
